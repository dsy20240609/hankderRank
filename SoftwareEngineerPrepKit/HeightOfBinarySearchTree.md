其实有时候有些问题第一步需要理解题意，然后你找不到那个逻辑的突破点，
但是大概用 brute force 的解法，你也可以知道问题所在。
binarySearchTree, for all the nodes in the tree, the left child if less than the its root
and right child value is larger than the root
this question gives you the tree information by three vectors
you can rebuild the tree structure from those information and use your familar way to deal with this information
